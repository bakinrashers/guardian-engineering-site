We value and respect all differences in all people (seen and unseen) at the Guardian. Here are some of the ways in which we help to promote a diverse and inclusive culture.

     <h2>Job advertisement and description screening!!</h2>
     We use an augmented writing tool which uses a combination of natural language processing and data mining to screen our job postings for unconscious bias, reveal gendered language and help our job ads to appeal to a more diverse range of candidates.
    <h2>Blind CV reviews</h2>
     We redact candidate's names and educational institutions from CVs before they are reviewed by members of the Engineering team to avoid unconscious bias in the selection process.

      <h2>Ada Lovelance Day</h2>
      <p>Girls aged 14-16 from a range of schools were invited to the Guardianâ€™s Education Centre for a day of events and workshops designed to give them insight into working in technology. The students found out about career paths, took a tour of our Digital department and took part in coding, UX and data workshops.</p>
