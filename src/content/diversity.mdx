      <ContentBoxTitle>Flexible working</ContentBoxTitle>
      <ContentBoxText>Flexible working can create a range of employment opportunities to suit both changing operational needs and the needs of individuals. It can also increase employment opportunities for anyone with caring responsibilities who are unable to work full time. We recognise the importance of flexible working as part of its wider commitment to diversity and equality in the workplace.</ContentBoxText>

      <ContentBoxTitle>Shared parental leave</ContentBoxTitle>
      <ContentBoxText>Shared parental leave is a period of leave of up to 50 weeks that can be shared between parents after their child is born up until the childâ€™s first birthday. It provides parents with more choice around how they balance their caregiving responsibilities and can help to improve diversity and inclusion in the workplace.</ContentBoxText>
