We value and respect all differences in all people (seen and unseen) at the Guardian. Here are some of the ways in which we help to promote a diverse and inclusive culture.

     <h2>Job advertisement and description screening</h2>
     We use an augmented writing tool which uses a combination of natural language processing and data mining to screen our job postings for unconscious bias, reveal gendered language and help our job ads to appeal to a more diverse range of candidates.
    <h2>Blind CV reviews</h2>
     We redact candidate's names and educational institutions from CVs before they are reviewed by members of the Engineering team to avoid unconscious bias in the selection process.
